# LevelUp
BioLU is a simple command line tool used to keep your hard drives clean. Specify an input folder and BioLU searches all subfolders and deletes all empty ones. If a subfolder contains only one file, it will be moved one level up and the directory will be deleted.

#LevelUp & Rename
BioLUR is another tool to move files matching a given filetype and (optionally) size from all subfolders to the main directory and renaming them after their inital folder. E.g. moving all folder.jpg CD covers from MyMusic subfolders and naming them after the album title.

Alternatively to command line usage, a single file can be dropped to the executable. The filetype parameter is then set automatically (according to the file's type), as well as the basedir (to ..\\).

Before performing any action, a confirmation prompt is displayed. With it, the current settings are displayed to check.
